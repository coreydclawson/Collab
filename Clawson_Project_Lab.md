# Public/Digital Humanities Institute 
<!-- Do you have a name for your institute? -->

## Picturing "Done" 

Describe your 2-3 sentences to a non-expert audience the purpose of your project. Does it solve a problem? Meet an institutional need? Put an existing resource to new use?

We hope to bring together a group of people sharing a common interests of making their scholarship more accessible through public digital humanities methods and enhancing their scholarship with DH techniques.  While the core of faculty interest has been around mapping technologies (a previous initiative organized around mapping dissipated in the months before the pandemic), we hope that this can be at the core of a wider set of tools and discussions.

## Audiences, Constituencies, and Collaborators

- Who will participate in, use, and/or benefit from the project?
- Is there a specific group already asking for this new resource? Who?
- The "general public" is too general an audience. the more specific your audience is the more likely you are to meet their needs.
- Is there anything that my audience can bring to my project?

**Audience:** Faculty who have expressed interest in previously failed mapping initiative. 

**Need:** Addressing this specific need by honing skills, starting conversations, and cultivating community.

**Audience:**  Graduate and advanced undergraduate students

**Need:** providing a space to develop skills that aren't addressed in their coursework.  As a graduate student, I had an idea, but there was no space to pursue that.  My advisors said "that's great," but had no idea how to support me. 
- HLLC - Clee @ Spellman Social Justice Fellows
- Public engagement as an "anchor institution"


**Stakeholder:**  P3 Collaboratory

**Need:** Organize discussions around faculty needs and goals so that this gap can better be filled and strategies can be developed. Drawing on existing resources and navigating.

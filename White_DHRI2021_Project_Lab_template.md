## Picturing "Done" 

The purpose of the RUN_DHRI is to create a community of practice around digital projects in the humanities and social sciences and provide faculty, undergraduate,  and graduate studnents with basic coding skills. Many at RUN develop digital projects, but are doing so in isloation. Coming together as a digital community of practice will help faculty and students develop their skills Fuand provide mutual aid and support for digital projects. Participatnts can learn from RUN_DHRI coordinators and one another to further their research and support other researchers on campus.

### Notes
- partner with NPL to OCR Spanish language transcripts from LOHP - turn into a corpus
- tranining community partners so that they can leverage their own materials
-EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS - good fit = 1. identify specific needs you have that they meet 2. what are they getting out of it, what are you getting out of it
- Formalize partership with written documentation. Make expectations clear.
